Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more people are taking online courses on Udemy. In our article, we will analyze the factors that influence the number of subscribers a course has. From our exploration, we concluded that people are generally more interested in taking technological related courses - and also that paid courses may yield more reviews or that unpiad courses may have a greater number of subscribers. This is likely because people enjoy having free courses to work with. Our results may have implications for businesses who are offering online courses, helping them to gauge what courses to offer to create a profit margin.
